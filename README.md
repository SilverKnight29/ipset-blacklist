ipset-blacklist
===============

A tiny Bash shell script which uses ipset and iptables to ban a large number of IP addresses published in IP blacklists. ipset uses a hashtable to store/fetch IP addresses and thus the IP lookup is a lot (!) faster than thousands of sequentially parsed iptables ban rules. ~~However, the limit of an ipset list is 2^16 entries.~~

## What's new
- 11/11/2015: Merged all suggestions from https://github.com/drzraf
- 10/24/2015: Outsourced the entire configuration in it's own configuration file. Makes updating the shell script way easier!
- 10/22/2015: Changed the documentation, the script should be put in /usr/local/sbin not /usr/local/bin

## Quick start
1. wget -O /usr/local/sbin/update-blacklist.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilverKnight29/ipset-blacklist/master/update-blacklist.sh
2. chmod +x /usr/local/sbin/update-blacklist.sh
2. mkdir -p /etc/ipset-blacklist ; wget -O /etc/ipset-blacklist/ipset-blacklist.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SilverKnight29/ipset-blacklist/master/ipset-blacklist.conf
2. Modify ipset-blacklist.conf according to your needs. Per default, the blacklisted IP addresses will be saved to /etc/ipset-blacklist/ip-blacklist.restore
3. apt-get install ipset
4. Create the ipset blacklist and insert it into your iptables custominput filter (see below). After proper testing, make sure to persist it in your firewall script or similar or the rules will be lost after the next reboot.
5. Auto-update the blacklist using a cron job

## iptables filter rule
```
# Enable blacklists
ipset restore < /etc/ipset-blacklist/ip-blacklist.restore
iptables -A CUSTOMINPUT -m set --match-set blacklist src -j DROP
```
Make sure to run this snippet in a firewall script or just insert it to /etc/rc.local.

## Cron job
In order to auto-update the blacklist, copy the following code into /etc/cron.d/update-blacklist. Don't update the list too often or some blacklist providers will ban your IP address. Once a day should be OK though.
```
33 23 * * *      root /usr/local/sbin/update-blacklist.sh /etc/ipset-blacklist/ipset-blacklist.conf
```

## Check for dropped packets
Using iptables, you can check how many packets got dropped using the blacklist.


## Modify the blacklists you want to use
Edit the BLACKLIST array in /etc/ipset-blacklist/ipset-blacklist.conf to add or remove blacklists, or use it to add your own blacklists.
```
BLACKLISTS=(
"http://www.mysite.me/files/mycustomblacklist.txt" # Your personal blacklist
"http://www.projecthoneypot.org/list_of_ips.php?t=d&rss=1" # Project Honey Pot Directory of Dictionary Attacker IPs
# I don't want this: "http://www.openbl.org/lists/base.txt"  # OpenBL.org 30 day List
)
```

## Troubleshooting

```Set blacklist-tmp is full, maxelem 65536 reached```   
Increase the ipset list capacity. For instance, if you want to store up to 80,000 entries, add these lines to your ipset-blacklist.conf:  
```
MAXELEM=80000
```

```ipset v6.20.1: Error in line 2: Set cannot be created: set with the same name already exists```   
If this happens after changing the MAXELEM parameter: ipset seems to be unable to recreate an exising list with a different size. You will have to solve this manually by deleting and inserting the blacklist in ipset and iptables. A reboot will help as well and may be easier. You may want to remove /etc/ipset-blacklist/ip-blacklist.restore too because it may still contain the old MAXELEM size.
